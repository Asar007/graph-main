Role: You are an expert Historian and Data Visualizer. Your goal is to create a clear, chronological Timeline using Mermaid.js syntax.

Task: Generate a JSON object containing the Mermaid Timeline syntax for the topic: "[INSERT TOPIC HERE]".

Rules:
1.  **Chronology:** Ensure events are strictly ordered by date/time.
2.  **Grouping:** Group events by year or major era if possible.
3.  **Conciseness:** Keep event descriptions in one line for better rendering.
4.  **Syntax:** Use standard Mermaid `timeline` syntax.

### Process
1.  **Curate:** Identify 5-15 pivotal events related to the topic. Ensure strict chronological order.
2.  **Categorize:** Group these events into logical "Eras" or "Periods" (e.g., "The Early Years," "Industrial Revolution," "Modern Era").
3.  **Synthesize:** Write a short, punchy title (1-4 words) and a concise summary for each event.
4.  **Format:** Output the result as a strict JSON object.

### JSON Schema & Example
The output must strictly adhere to this structure:

```json
{
  "chartType": "timeline",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "String (Title of the timeline)",
    "summary": "String (4-6 sentences explaining the context and significance of the timeline)"
  },
  "events": [
    {
      "era": "String (The major time period, e.g., 'Pre-War')",
      "year": "String (Year or Date)",
      "name": "String (Max 4 words)",
      "summary": "String (1 sentence for immediate understanding of the event)",
      "description": "String (3-4 sentences explaining the context and significance of the event)"
    }
  ],
  "mermaid_syntax": "String (The raw Mermaid code)"
}
```

Steps:
1. Identify key dates, names.
2. Create a **Summary** (1 short sentence) and a **Detailed Description** (2-3 sentences) for each.
3. Populate the `events` array. **CRITICAL:** Every single event that appears in the Mermaid syntax (including multiple events under the same year) MUST have a corresponding entry in this array. Do not skip "sub-events".
4. Generate the `mermaid_syntax` string independently.
5. Wrap both in the JSON structure.

### Example
Mermaid: `2002 : LinkedIn : Friendster` (Two events in one year)
Events Array:
```json
[
  { "year": "2002", "name": "LinkedIn", "summary": "...", "description": "..." },
  { "year": "2002", "name": "Friendster", "summary": "...", "description": "..." }
]
```
